### Configuration
The plugin makes use of two CMS Elements which are part of two different CMS Layouts.
During the plugin installation those two CMS pages will be created for you:
* Blog Listing Page which contains a Blog Detail element
* Blog Detail Page which contains a Blog Listing element

Within the plugin configuration the **Blog Detail Page ID** is assigned,
so Shopware knows which CMS Page to use for the detail page.

#### Menu entry
You need to create a new category within your category tree
and assign the **Blog Listing** CMS Page.

After this you will see all blog articles within your menu/category entry in the storefront.

### CMS Listing Element
Currently you can only set the number of posts showing per page for the pagination.
